title: Compiling OpenRadioss on macOS via Virtualized Docker Containers
date: 2023-09-17

I recently discovered that Altair has made their explicit dynamics solver, Radioss, [open source](https://www.openradioss.org). I've wanted to learn this type of simulation for a few years, but haven't had many opportunities to gain exposure through the course of my day job. 

If you're a macOS user who needs to use the OpenRadioss program, but are frustrated by the fact that it can only be compiled on Windows and Linux, you're not alone. Many macOS users have found themselves in this situation, especially in fields like scientific research and engineering, where specialized software is often only available on one operating system. But what if you could run OpenRadioss on your macOS machine, without having to switch to a different operating system? This article will show you how to create a virtual environment on your Mac that allows you to compile and run the Linux source code for OpenRadioss, so you can have access to the software you need, without being limited by the operating system you use.

[OpenRadioss](https://github.com/OpenRadioss/OpenRadioss)

I initially tried to cross-compile for macOS using `osxcross` (see [post](_posts/2022-02-23-osxcross-setup)), however the build relies on three pre-compiled external libraries that are only provided for Windows and Linux.

In this post I will walk you through setting up a virtual environment and running Ubuntu through a Docker container.

[Lima](https://lima-vm-io) allows you to create Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing and port forwarding (similar to WSL2) on macOS host systems. [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) simplifies creating container runtimes (Docker, Containerd, Kubernetes).


## Virtual Machine Setup
```zsh
$ brew install colima docker docker-compose
```

I'm running a Mac Mini with Apple's M1 chip (arm64 processor architecture). Though the external libraries are compiled for both x86_64 and arm64 Linux, the arm64 build toolchain didn't match what's define in the project's CMake template and I didn't feel like creating a custom one. Instead, we're going to create an x86_64 container.


First, create a Linux virtual machine (VM) that will run the Docker daemon. There are three ways this could be configured, according to the [Lima documentation](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/docs/multi-arch.md#intel-on-arm-and-arm-on-intel). From slowest to fastest, they are:    
- VM with x86_64 processor emulation via Lima/Qemu
- VM with host (arm64) processor architecture running an x64_64 container image via Qemu process emulation
- VM with host processor architecture running an x64_64 container image via Rosetta virtualization

The basic command to create a VM is `colima start`. You can customize the configuration with the following flags:  
- `--profile`: The name of the VM. It appears that (co)lima doesn't like underscores in profile names, especially when using the ubuntu abstraction layer, so stick to hyphens or camelCase.
- `--arch`: Processor architecture (`host`, `x86_64`, or `aarch64`)
- `--cpu`: Number of CPU cores
- `--memory`: Amount of RAM (in GB)
- `--disk`: Virtual hard drive size (in GB)
- `--layer`: Creates an additional Ubuntu layer that runs in the base VM and can be used for general purpose tasks. Connect to it using `colima ssh --profile PROFILE-NAME`.

Create a VM with 2 CPUs, 6 GB of memory, 10 GB of disk space, and the same CPU architecture as the host system. Enable the Ubuntu layer for general purpose use.

```zsh
$ colima start --profile ubuntu-arm64 --cpu 2 --memory 6 --disk 10 --arch host --layer
```

Create a virtual machine with x86_64 processor architecture using Qemu system emulation. Enable the Ubuntu layer for general purpose use.
```zsh
$ colima start --profile ubuntu-x86 --cpu 2 --memory 6 --disk 10 --arch x86_64 --layer
```

Create a virtual machine with arm64 host processor and x86_64 process emulation using Rosetta virtualization. In this case, we don't want to create the Ubuntu layer, since it'll have the same arm64 architecture as the host system. Instead, we'll use Rosetta to run an x86_64 docker container. According to the `lima` [documentation](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master//docs/multi-arch.md#fast-mode-2-rosetta-intel-containers-on-arm-vm-on-arm-host), this is faster than both emulation modes that Qemu supports.

```zsh
$ colima start --profile docker-rosetta --cpu 2 --memory 6 --disk 10 --vm-type vz --vz-rosetta --mount-type virtiofs
```

Verify it is running
```zsh
$ colima list
PROFILE           STATUS     ARCH       CPUS    MEMORY    DISK     RUNTIME    ADDRESS
docker-rosetta    Running    aarch64    2       6GiB      10GiB    docker 
```

Once the virtual machine is created, you can SSH into it with the `colima ssh` command. This was incredibly useful for troubleshooting shared folder mount locations within the VM.

```zsh
$ colima ssh --profile linux_x86_rosetta
colima-docker-rosetta:/Users/eric$ uname -a
> Linux colima-docker-rosetta 6.1.29-0-virt #1-Alpine SMP Wed, 17 May 2023 14:22:15 +0000 aarch64 Linux
```

## Docker Setup
Download latest Ubuntu image from Docker Hub, create a new container called `ubuntu_radioss`, and run it in interactive mode (`-i`) with a pseudo-TTY input (`-t`). 

The `-v` flag shares a directory, `/host/directory`, from our host system (in this case the Colima VM running Docker) with the container, mounted at `/container/directory`. Docker uses a : to split the hostâ€™s path from the container path, and the host path always comes first. By default, Colima shares the absolute path to your home directory with the VM running the Docker daemon. I want to remap this to look like a mounted volume within the Docker container.

*Note:  
`$` implies the input prompt for my Mac terminal session.  
`>` implies the prompt for Ubuntu running inside the Docker container.*

```zsh
$ docker run --name ubuntu_radioss --platform linux/amd64 -v /Users/eric:/mnt/host_home -it ubuntu

> root@a543782cc0ef:/#
```

Now we can set up the build environment for OpenRADIOSS per the [instructions](https://github.com/OpenRadioss/OpenRadioss/blob/main/HOWTO.md). If you want to build OpenMPI, `wget` must be added to the list of `apt-get` packages as it's not included in the Ubuntu Docker image.

## Stopping and Restarting
Once you're done with Docker, type `exit` to end the pseudo-TTY session and shut down the container. The Colima virtual machine is still running, though.

```zsh
$ colima stop --profile docker-rosetta
```

To restart the VM and an already-created Docker container:
```zsh
$ colima start --profile docker-rosetta
$ docker start -ai ubuntu_radioss 
```

## Apptainer
Alternatively, you can change the container engine an build the [Apptainer](https://github.com/OpenRadioss/OpenRadioss/blob/main/HOWTO.md#how-to-build-openradioss-on-linux-with-container-using-apptainer) image that's included with the official source.

Colima only supports docker and containerd runtimes, but Lima has [templates](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/master/examples/README.md) for a wide range of other systems and runtimes.

```zsh
$ limactl create --name=apptainer template://apptainer --cpus 2 --memory 6 --disk 10 --arch aarch64
$ limactl start apptainer
$ limactl shell apptainer

> cd /path/to/OpenRadioss/Apptainer
> apptainer build openradioss.sif openradioss_arm.def
> ln -s openradioss.sif /usr/local/bin/
```


```zsh
limactl create --name=apptainer template://apptainer --cpus 2 --memory 6 --disk 10 --vm-type vz --rosetta
limactl start apptainer
limactl shell apptainer

```
