## Welcome
Hey there! I'm Eric. I studied aerospace engineering at MIT and have spent the first 10 years of my career as a structures engineer for a wide variety of spacecraft ranging from shoebox-sized experimental cubesats to human-rated capsules. Along the way, I've noticed that a lot of the tools we use are clunky and lag far behind the beautiful interfaces and painless user experiences that modern web apps are innovating on every day.

This site aims to showcase the various widgets I develop as I teach myself JS, React, and other web technologies and use those new skills to make engineering tools that are more user-friendly than what I suspect many of us are used to.
