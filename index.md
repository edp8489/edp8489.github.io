## Welcome
I'm an aerospace structures engineer by trade. All too often I find myself remaking the same "quick and dirty" Excel analysis tool *(cringe)* or thinking "there HAS to be a better way" to do some tedious task. Here's my attempt to rectify that.

The purpose of this site is to showcase the various widgets I develop as I teach myself JS, React, and other web technologies. Most projects will be engineering tools that aim to be more user-friendly than whatever I was using at the time that prompted the idea.

## Tools
- Galvanic Compatibility - Visualize the potential for galvanic corrosion between pairs of dissimilar metals and recommended surface treatments for each. References MIL-STD-889-C.
