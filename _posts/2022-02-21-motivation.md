I ***hate*** Excel. 

Okay, that's a minor exaggeration. I hate 1) Excel being used to make engineering tools, 2) how easy it is throw together a quick calculator with a GUI, and 3) how those files inevitably snowball into multi-tab, 50 MB monstrosities (with *cringe* VBA macros) that are impossible to debug.

Every time I have to deal with one of these files (spoiler alert: every day), my first thought is "there HAS to be a better way to do this." Web frameworks, scripting languages, and interface toolkits have advanced so much in the last few years that there are countless combinations of "better ways".

**It's time I stop complaining and actually do something about it.**

I have a running list of topics that have triggered my "this can be better" reflex. I've started teaching myself how to build interactive webapps using JavaScript and React and am slowly chipping away at the list. With any luck, these tools will end up being useful to the broader enginnering community.
