Time for another edition of "I spent way too long deep diving what I thought was a straightforward topic, so now it's a blog post!"

The following discussion is based on data for 0.250 diameter (~M6) CSR 924 reduced shear head rivets in clad aluminum 7075-T6 sheet.

For thin sheets up to a thickness of D/2, the data follows a linear trend that is parallel to the parent material (A-basis) bearing strength. At sheet thicknesses 0.5*D - 0.75*D, the data points diverge from the ideal bearing-shear envelope and an obvious knee appears in the trend line. Joint failure in this region can be considered mixed-mode and is influenced by factors including (...). The final data point for sheet thickness t = D matches
