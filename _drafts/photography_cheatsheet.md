Here's a quick cheat sheet of photography basics and rules of thumb that I collated mostly as a reference to myself after watching about 3 hours of YouTube videos. 

## Shutter Speed
- Good general purpose setting for handheld shots is in the 1/250 - 1/125 range
- Action shots require 1/2000 - 1/1000
- To avoid star trails while taking long exposure night shots, the maximum duration is related to your lens focal length and sensor size
  - "500 rule" (based on a 35mm equivalent lens/camera setup
  - tmax = 500/(focal length)
  - E.g. for a 35mm lens: tmax = 500/35 = 14.3 s

## Aperture <--> Depth of Field Relationship
- Depth of field refers to how much of your image is in focus
- Larger apertures let in more light, allow for quicker shutter speed, but at the expense of decreased depth of field.
- Smaller apertures let in less light, require slower shutter speed, allow higher depth of field
- Shallow depth of field: Subject is in focus, background is very blurry
  - Used for single-person portraits and low-light shots
  - Aperture range f/1.4 - f/3.5
- Medium depth of field: Subject is in focus, background is moderately blurry
  - Used for group photos or scenes where you want a discernable background but without sharp details
  - Aperture f/4-f/8 (up to f/11 or so)
- Wide depth of field: Subject and background are in focus
  - Useful for landscape photography
  - Aperture range f/8 and higher (up to f/13 to f/22)

## Sensor Size & (Equivalent) Focal Length
- Cameras have different sensor sizes
- Using the frame size of a 35mm film camera as a reference point, you can estimate the field of view you'll get for a specific lens/camera combination.
- "Crop factor" for a digital sensor is the multiplier used for this conversion
  - Full-frame sensor: Crop factor = 1
  - APS-C sensor: Crop factor = 1.5
  - Cell phone sensor: Crop factor = 3.2 (TBR)
