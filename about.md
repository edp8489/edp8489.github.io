## Bio
I studied aerospace engineering at MIT, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in 2011 and 2014. My graduate research focused on small spacecraft/instrument development (think: shoebox-to-dishwasher size scale). Notable projects include design, development, and integration of the MicroMAS ([1](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/projectmicromas), [2](https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/micromas-cubesat-technology-provides-fresh-approach-weather-forecasting)) 3U CubeSat technology demonstrator and preliminary structural design of the [REXIS](https://www.asteroidmission.org/?attachment_id=1205#main) x-ray spectrometer instrument for NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. 

After finishing my master's, I spent two years at a startup working on the preliminary design of composite structures for low-cost, expendable launch vehicles.

In late 2016 I joined Blue Origin as a structures engineer for the [New Shepard](https://www.blueorigin.com/new-shepard/) Crew Capsule. I've provided design and analysis support for multiple vehicles across multiple lifecycle phases, including involvement with verification activities in support of human flight certification. Along the way I've authored countless analysis packages. 

## Motivation
For any problem I've come across, countless others will as well. I want to share what I've learned with the hope that it may fill in a blank or save someone a bit of time on their engineering journey.

Some of the content you can expect includes:
- More accessible [engineering tools](/portfolio.md)
- [Blog posts](/posts.md) that deep-dive various technical topics I come across during daily work or share design tips that could be useful during the preliminary design phase

Whenever possible, I'll do my best to include links to publicly-accessible references for any data used in technical posts, rather than exclusively reference expensive journal papers or industry specs.
