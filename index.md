## Welcome to My GitHub Page

The purpose of this site is to showcase the various widgets I develop as I teach myself JS, React, and other web technologies.

My day job is as an aerospace structures engineer. Most projects will be engineering tools that aim to be more user-friendly than whatever I was using at the time.
