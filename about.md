title: About Me
---

I studied aerospace engineering at MIT, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in 2011 and 2014. My research experience was focused on small (think: shoebox to dishwasher size scale) spacecraft/instrument development. After finishing my master's, I spent two years at a rocket startup doing preliminary design of composite primary structures for expendable vehicles. 

For the past five years I've worked at Blue Origin as a structures engineer on the New Shepard Crew Capsule. I've supported design verification for the first human-rated capsule, redesigned the primary structure for future upgraded vehicles, and authored countless analysis packages. 

One thing I've noticed though the wonders of hindsight is that "moving fast" during the preliminary design phase -- especially making design decisions based on limited development testing or an incomplete set of material/loads data -- can come back to bite you once the time comes to fully characterize that weird joint's strength or get in the rest of the data for your material system. 

I want to share design tips I've learned along the way that can be implemented during the preliminary design phase that should help prevent additional design iterations after the inevitable loads increase, lower than expected test results, requirements update...
