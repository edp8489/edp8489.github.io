One thing I've noticed though the wonders of hindsight is that "moving fast" during the preliminary design phase -- especially making design decisions based on limited development testing or an incomplete set of material/loads data -- can lead to a mountain of additional work when the time comes to complete design verification.

I want to share tips that, if implemented early in the design process, could potentially reduce the number of pain points that pop up during verification. I also plan to share any insights that I gain while deep-diving any technical topics that arise as part of my day job. If I can consolidate hours of research into a useful blog post that someone can read in 15 minutes, I'll consider that a success.

Also... I ***hate*** Excel. 

Okay, that's a minor exaggeration. I hate 1) Excel being used to make engineering tools, 2) how easy it is throw together a quick calculator with a GUI, and 3) how those files inevitably snowball into multi-tab, 50+ MB monstrosities (with *cringe* VBA macros) that are impossible to debug.

Every time I have to deal with one of these files (spoiler alert: every day), my first thought is "there HAS to be a better way to do this." Web frameworks, scripting languages, and interface toolkits have advanced so much in the last few years that there are countless combinations of "better ways".

**It's time I stop complaining and actually do something about it.**

I have a running list of topics that have triggered my "this can be better" reflex. I've started teaching myself how to build interactive webapps using JavaScript and React and am slowly chipping away at the list. With any luck, these tools will end up being useful to the broader enginnering community.
