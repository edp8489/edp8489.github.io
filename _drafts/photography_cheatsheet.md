Here's a quick cheat sheet of photography basics and rules of thumb that I collated mostly as a reference to myself after watching about 3 hours of YouTube videos. 

## Shutter Speed
- Good general purpose setting for handheld shots is in the 1/250 - 1/125 range
  - Compensates for motion blur induced by shaky hands
  - Lower limit (slowest acceptable shuttle speed) can be estimated by 1/(focal length)
- Action shots require 1/1000 or faster (down to 1/4000)
- To avoid star trails while taking long exposure night shots, the maximum duration is related to your lens focal length and sensor size
  - "500 rule" (based on a 35mm equivalent lens/camera setup)
  - tmax = 500/(focal length)
  - e.g. for a 35mm lens: tmax = 500/35 = 14.3 s

## Aperture <--> Depth of Field Relationship
- Depth of field refers to how much of your image is in focus
- Larger apertures let in more light, allowing for quicker shutter speed, but at the expense of decreased depth of field.
- Smaller apertures let in less light, allow higher depth of field, but require slower shutter speed (or higher ISO).
- Shallow depth of field: Subject is in focus, background is very blurry
  - Used for single-person portraits and low-light shots
  - Aperture range f/1.4 - f/3.5
- Medium depth of field: Subject is in focus, background is moderately blurry
  - Used for group photos or scenes where you want a discernable background but without sharp details
  - Aperture f/4-f/8 (up to f/11 or so)
- Wide depth of field: Subject and background are in focus
  - Useful for landscape photography
  - Aperture range f/11 and beyond (up to f/22)

## ISO (Light Sensitivity)
- Higher ISO = more noise
- ISO 400 standard for normal day shot
- Bright, sunny day, ISO 100-200

## Sensor Size & (Equivalent) Focal Length
- Cameras have different sensor sizes
- Using the frame size of a 35mm film camera as a reference point, you can estimate the field of view you'll get for a specific lens/camera combination.
- "Crop factor" for a digital sensor is the multiplier used for this conversion
  - Full-frame sensor: Crop factor = 1
  - APS-C sensor: Crop factor = 1.5
  - Cell phone (1/1.3" sensor): Crop factor = 3.5
