title: About Me
---

I studied aerospace engineering at MIT, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in 2011 and 2014. My research experience focused on small (think: shoebox-to-dishwasher size scale) spacecraft/instrument development. After finishing my master's, I spent two years at a rocket startup working on the preliminary design of composite structures for low-cost, expendable launch vehicles. 

I've spent the last five years at Blue Origin as a structures engineer for the New Shepard Crew Capsule. I've supported design verification for the first human-rated capsule, updated primary structure designs for future vehicle iterations, and along the way have authored countless analysis packages. 

One thing I've noticed though the wonders of hindsight is that "moving fast" during the preliminary design phase -- especially making design decisions based on limited development testing or an incomplete set of material/loads data -- can come back to bite you once the time comes to fully characterize that weird joint's strength or get in the rest of the data for your material system. 

I want to share design tips I've learned along the way that can be implemented during the preliminary design phase that should help prevent additional design iterations after the inevitable loads increase, lower than expected test results, requirements update...
