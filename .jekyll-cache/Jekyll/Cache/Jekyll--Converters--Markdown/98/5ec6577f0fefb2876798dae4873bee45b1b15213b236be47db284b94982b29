I"¡<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm an aerospace structures engineer by trade. All too often I find myself remaking the same ‚Äúquick and dirty‚Äù Excel analysis tool <em>(cringe)</em> or thinking ‚Äúthere HAS to be a better way‚Äù to do some tedious task. Here‚Äôs my attempt to rectify that.</p>

<p>The purpose of this site is to showcase the various widgets I develop as I teach myself JS, React, and other web technologies. Most projects will be engineering tools that aim to be more user-friendly than whatever I was using at the time that prompted the idea.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Galvanic Compatibility - Visualize the potential for galvanic corrosion between pairs of dissimilar metals and recommended surface treatments for each. References MIL-STD-889-C. <a href="https://edp8489.github.io/galvanic_compatibility">Use the tool</a> | <a href="https://github.com/edp8489/galvanic_compatibility">Link to repository</a></li>
